# oversteel-qmk
QMK firmware for Oversteel Titanium Red (105-keys).  
To make use of this, you need to follow the [SonixQMK Docs](https://sonixqmk.github.io//SonixDocs/install/).  
Using stock QMK without following the documentation above will produce a firmware not compatible with the Sonix fork of QMK.


**MISSING:** 
- Side RGB Customization  
- Parity with Stock Behavior/FN keys
- Led status for caps lock, block scroll and block num
